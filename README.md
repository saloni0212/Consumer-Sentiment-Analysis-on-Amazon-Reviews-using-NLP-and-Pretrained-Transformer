# Consumer-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Reviews-using-NLP-and-Pretrained-Transformer

<h2>Overview</h2>
Customer Sentiment Analysis refers to extracting and analyzing textual data to discern customers' underlying sentiments, attitudes, and opinions. To achieve this, there are 3 approaches : Lexicon-based, ML-based and Pre-Trained Transformer-based. This sentiment analysis is done using the third approach i.e. Pre-Trained Transformer-based approach.
This project aims to analyze consumer sentiments in Amazon reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project compares the performance of three pre-trained transformer models: VADER, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT.
